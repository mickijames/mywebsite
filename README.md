# Micalyn Williams' Personal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and deployed using gh-pages.

(To view compiled src code, go to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/mickijames/mywebsite/).)

## MyWebsite
This entire project has been built with React.js. 

I was working on my portfolio and wanted to expand my web skills. So after researching React for awhile, I decided it would be a fun challenge and a cool way to implement my personal website.
